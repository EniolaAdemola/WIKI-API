# WIKI-API
My Process of learning RESTful API


This project is basically about me learning about API's, EJS, BodyParser, mongoose and the core function of creating a backend app.

NB: There's isn't live demo of this project to see how it works kindly follow this step below: 
- make sure you have node installed on your pc, go to your command line and run the command bellow
- mkdir WIKI-API
- cd WIKI-API
- `git clone https://github.com/EniolaAdemola/WIKI-API.git
`
- `npm install
`
- `node app.js
`
#### That's all you need to get started and you would see a live demo on your default browser. feel free to reach me below for any question.
